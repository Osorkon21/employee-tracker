// WHEN I choose to add a department

// Query database - sample SQL query if you're not using Sequelize (results are a JSON, I think)
db.query('SELECT * FROM employee', function (err, results) {
  printTable(results);
});

// do I need to use express? Don't think so

// do I need to be able to create new databases on other users' computers, or just mine? If just mine, what do I put in Instructions in README?

// do I need to give the user the ability to disconnect from the database at any point? Or is it assumed user exits app by killing terminal?

// how do I get the big splash screen on the console like in the walkthrough video?
